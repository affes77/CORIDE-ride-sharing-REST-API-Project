The ride-sharing API project is a web application that allows users to offer rides between different locations.
Users can create an account and login to the application using their email and password. 
Once logged in, they can create a new ride by specifying the start and end locations, start and end times, and other details.
Other users can then view a list of available rides and request to join a ride.
Users can also view and modify their own rides, as well as cancel rides that they have created.
The API provides a number of endpoints for creating, modifying, deleting, and querying rides, as well as for user authentication and authorization.
Check the requirements.txt file to see the python packages the project depends on.
